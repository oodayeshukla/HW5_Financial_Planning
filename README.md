# Homework 5 Financial Planning

The theme of this assignment is to download stock/asset data from an online data provider (in this example, Alpaca) and perform Monte Carlo simulations to forecast probable returns 5, 10, 20, and 30 years out, given an initial one time investment.

The results were as expected, higher initial investment over a longer time period yields more favorable results. 

An extension to his exercise would be to incorporate periodic investments with and without an initial investment. 

NOTE: The Alpaca API now allows a maximum of 1000 samples to be downloaded per symbol.  This corresponds to ~3.9 years of data.  Overall, given the dynamics and black swan events over the last 3 years, 3 years of historical data is more appropriate than 5 years to perform these simulations.
