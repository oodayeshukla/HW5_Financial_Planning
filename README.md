# Homework 5 Financial Planning

The theme of this assignment is to download stock/asset data from an online data provider (in this example, Alpaca) and perform Monte Carlo simulations to forecast probable returns 5, 10, 20, and 30 years out, given an initial one time investment.

An extension to his exercise would be to incorporate periodic investments with and without an initial investment.
